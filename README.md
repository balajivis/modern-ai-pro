## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the heart disease dataset.
- **Model Building**: A Keras-based deep learning model to predict heart disease presence.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask-powered web interface to input health metrics and receive predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/balajivis/modern-ai-pro.git
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Download the latest dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset -- I have a .csv already included, just in case.

2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train-heartdisease.py
    ```


3. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app-heart.py
    ```

4. Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Input the required health metrics and get a prediction on the likelihood of heart disease.
